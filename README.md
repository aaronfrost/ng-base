Base Angular + Node + Express app w/ Pure CSS for layout
========================
Often I need to new up an Angular app that has some style, and a node backend. This project
represents a simple starting point. Bits like Angular seed have a shload of things included, 
and I am often in need of something much simpler. This is that.
